<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) valve market is divided into two primary types: fixed valves and adjustable valves. Fixed valves maintain a consistent opening pressure, delivering a predetermined flow rate of CSF, which is beneficial for patients with stable conditions. In contrast, adjustable valves allow for modification of the opening pressure, offering tailored treatment that can adapt to changes in a patientâ€™s condition. This flexibility enhances management of conditions such as hydrocephalus, making adjustable valves increasingly popular in clinical practice.</p></p>
