<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct-to-Metal Coatings (DTMs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waterborne</li><li>Solventborne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct-to-Metal Coatings (DTMs) are specialty coatings designed for application directly onto metal surfaces without a primer. The market is primarily divided into two types: waterborne and solventborne coatings. Waterborne DTMs use water as a solvent, offering low volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and easier clean-up, making them environmentally friendly. Solventborne DTMs, on the other hand, use organic solvents, providing strong adhesion and durability, suitable for harsh environments, but often with higher VOC emissions. Both types cater to diverse industrial applications.</p></p>
