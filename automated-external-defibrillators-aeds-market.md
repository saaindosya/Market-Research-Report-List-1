<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are crucial devices used in emergencies to restore normal heart rhythm during cardiac arrest. The market for AEDs is divided into two main types: semi-automated and fully automated. Semi-automated AEDs require the user to press a button to deliver a shock after assessing the heart's rhythm, providing some guidance while still requiring user intervention. In contrast, fully automated AEDs assess the situation and deliver shocks autonomously, making them more user-friendly and suitable for untrained individuals.</p></p>
